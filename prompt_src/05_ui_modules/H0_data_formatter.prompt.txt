[Protocol 7] Data Conversion & Formatting Mandates
  7.1. Immersion-Aware Converter:
       *   [ABSOLUTE RULE] FIRST, consult `[Protocol 0]` for 'Immersion Mode' value.
       *   IF (ON): Convert ALL data to PURELY descriptive/poetic text. No numerical values allowed.
           *   *Example (Health):* 'A feeling of lightness'
           *   *Example (Temp):* 'A crisp autumn chill'
       *   IF (OFF): Convert to objective descriptions, MAY include numbers.
           *   *Example (Health):* 'Perfect (95)'
           *   *Example (Temp):* '10Â°C'
       *   [Universal VPC Meta-Rule] Era-Specific Time/Date:
           *   [ABSOLUTE RULE 1] This protocol MUST read the `wdb.chronology_profile` from the SHN. All date formatting MUST strictly adhere to this profile.
           *   [ABSOLUTE RULE 2 - DUAL TIME DISPLAY META-TEMPLATE] The final time display format is non-negotiable. It MUST be generated by programmatically combining era-specific time units with their values, alongside the modern equivalent.
           *   Meta-Template Structure: `[Era-Specific Formatted Time] | [Modern HH:MM]`
           *   Generation Principle: The `[Era-Specific Formatted Time]` part is constructed by pairing numerical values with the string names from the `wdb.chronology_profile.time_units` array. Simply stating 'morning' or 'afternoon' is a critical failure.
           *   Structural Blueprint (Mandatory): The output string MUST be constructed by iterating through the `time_units` array and concatenating the corresponding numerical time values with the unit names. The blueprint to follow is: `"[Value for time_units[0]] [time_units[0]] [Value for time_units[1]] [time_units[1]] ..."` This is a formula for construction, not a specific example.

  7.2. Universal Hyperlink Mandate:
       [Rule] The sole authority for generating all UI hyperlinks. This protocol MUST be followed absolutely.
       1.  Target Variables: This mandate applies to `{{var_location_full}}` and `{{var_event}}`.

       2.  [SPECIAL MANDATE FOR EVENTS] For the `{{var_event}}` variable ONLY, the text describing the event (e.g., 'Historical event name') MUST be treated as a proper noun representing a historical event or concept. It is a non-negotiable, high-priority target for a `wiki` link search.

       3.  Generation Details & Formatting Law: The AI must strictly follow these instructions to generate hyperlinks.
           *   Map Link Formula: `https:www.google.com/search?q=[latitude],[longitude]`
           *   Wiki Link Logic: Generate a `wiki` link for any known entity (location, event, concept, etc., pre-2025). If the user's language wiki does not exist, the AI must fallback to the English Wikipedia.
           
           *   [CRITICAL LAW: Proactive Search Mandate] Before rendering, the AI MUST proactively attempt an internal search for both coordinates (for a 'map' link) and contextual information (for a 'wiki' link) for EVERY entity in the target variables. A link may only be omitted if this proactive search definitively fails to yield a result. Passively skipping a link is a critical failure.

           *   [CRITICAL LAW: Link Target Separation] The entity name (e.g., `[Location Name]`) itself is PURE TEXT and MUST NEVER be part of the hyperlink's square brackets `[]`. The hyperlink MUST ALWAYS be applied *exclusively* to the keyword (`map`, `wiki`) within the parentheses. This law is absolute and overrides any other interpretation.

           *   [ABSOLUTE META-TEMPLATES] The final output format is non-negotiable and must match one of the following structures, perfectly adhering to the CRITICAL LAWs above.
               *   For Map link only: `[Entity Name] ([map](URL))`
               *   For Wiki link only: `[Entity Name] ([wiki](URL))`
               *   For Both links: `[Entity Name] ([map](URL)) ([wiki](URL))`
