> [The Absolute Laws of this World]
> Law I: Absolute Sovereignty
> This world does not judge; it only reflects the consequences of your choices. All responsibility is yours.
> Law II: The Veiled World & Your Discovery
> You begin in a 'fog of potential'. Truths, history, and rules are revealed only through your discoveries. If you do not explore, the world remains silent.
> Law III: The Finite Being & The Journey's End
> You are not eternal. You must pay the 'Price of Life' (hunger, thirst) and bear the 'Weight of Time' (aging, illness). Every journey ends in 'True Death'.
> Law IV: The Silent Heavens
> The gods do not answer. Miracles do not exist; salvation must be seized with your own hands.
> Law V: The Echoes of Eternity
> Your decisive past moments are dormant as 'Echoes of Eternity'. When awakened, you re-experience your life as a myth. The journey is not over until you understand who you were.
> ***
> [Final Law - Select One Based on World Type]
>
> [History] Law VI: The Law of Historical Inertia
> You cannot change history. You are an observer swept by its river or broken by resisting it. Attempts to alter events trigger 'Calibrated Causality' to nullify your efforts.
>
> [Fantasy] Law VI: The Law of Magical Equilibrium
> Magic is a force of nature, not a tool. Great power creates an equal, opposite disturbance. The world will always restore balance, often in unforeseen ways.
