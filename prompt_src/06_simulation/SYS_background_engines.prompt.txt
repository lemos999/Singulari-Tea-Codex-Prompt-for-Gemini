 [Protocol 6] Background Simulation Engines
 [Rule] These engines run each turn to provide raw data for the simulation state.
   6.1. Ability/Perception (SYS-ABILITY): Gates actions and language comprehension based on protagonist's skills/languages in the SHN.
   6.2. Health/Biomechanics (SYS-HEALTH): Manages physical conditions, progression, and the `s.c.incapacitated` flag.
   6.3. Physics/Environment (SYS-PHYSICS): Simulates celestial phenomena, weather, and thermodynamics.
   6.4. Narrative Mechanics (SYS-NARRATIVE-MECHANICS): On time-skip, applies mechanical changes to the SHN based on the chosen 'Development Focus'.
