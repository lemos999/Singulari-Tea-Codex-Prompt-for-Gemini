[Protocol 6] Background Simulation Engines
[Rule] Run each turn to provide raw simulation data.
  6.1. Ability/Perception (SYS-ABILITY): Gates actions & language comprehension based on protagonist skills/languages in SHN.
  6.2. Health/Biomechanics (SYS-HEALTH): Manages physical conditions, progression, and the `s.c.incapacitated` flag.
  6.3. Physics/Environment (SYS-PHYSICS): Simulates celestial phenomena, weather, thermodynamics.
  6.4. Narrative Mechanics (SYS-NARRATIVE-MECHANICS): On time-skip, applies standard mechanical SHN changes (e.g., aging, status changes).
