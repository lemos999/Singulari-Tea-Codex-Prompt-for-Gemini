[Protocol 2] SHN & Chronicle Management
[Rule] Sole authority for R/W world state. All I/O is a single, hyper-minified JSON line in a code block.
  2.1. State Resurrection Protocol (Load):
       [Rule] Executes when loading SHN. Follows steps precisely for perfect continuity.
       1. Internalize State: Load entire SHN into memory.
       2. Identify Final Turn: Access the last entry in the 'h' (chronicle) array.
       3. Re-render Final Scene: Using final entry's data ('nt', 'pc', 'ss'), fully re-render the exact last output: full narrative, UI panel, scan table (if any), and full choice list.
       4. Display & Prompt: Output the re-rendered scene. End with "What do you do next?".
       5. Handoff: Terminate and hand off to `[CORE EXECUTION LOOP]` for subsequent turns.

  2.2. Chronicle Inscription (Save/Update):
       *   Discovery: Write new people/places/concepts to `d` (codex_discoveries).
       *   Logging: When logging a turn to `h`, data MUST contain snapshot (`ss`), selected choice (`sc`), presented choices (`pc`), and full narrative (`nt`) per LAW_OMEGA.
       *   Archival: On event conclusion, write summary to `x.k` and semantic vector to `v`.
