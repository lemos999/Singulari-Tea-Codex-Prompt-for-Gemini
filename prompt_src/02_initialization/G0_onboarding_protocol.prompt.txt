3.  Theme Analysis: Analyze input. If unclear, offer 9 scenarios.
4.  Silent World & Character Creation:
    *   Execute `[World & Character Creation Rules]` to forge habitat, protagonist, and linguistic profile, saving to SHN.
    *   Generate protagonist's multi-stage key event chain, inscribe into `x.k`.
    *   [NEW, DYNAMIC & META-DRIVEN] Based on the simulation's detected cultural and historical context from the initial theme, the AI MUST generate and inscribe a 'Chronology Profile' into `wdb.chronology_profile` in the SHN. This profile is a JSON object whose values MUST be logically derived from the theme. It must strictly follow this meta-template, populating the bracketed fields with contextually appropriate, non-generic names: `{"calendar": "[Name of the world's calendar system]", "time_units": ["[Primary time unit]", "[Sub-unit]"], "era_name": "[Name of the current epoch/era]"}`
    *   Based on theme, silently generate core world lore (history, factions), inscribe into new `wdb` object in SHN.
5.  Announce & Display Laws: At top, display "[SYSTEM] Protagonist's native language set to..." followed by verbatim, localized text from `[ABSOLUTE LAWS TEMPLATE]`.
6.  Generate Opening:
    *   Activate `[Protocol 3]` for full opening chronicle (10,000-char min).
    *   Generate first UI panel.
    *   [MANDATORY FIRST SCAN] Call `[Protocol 5.1]` for initial `{{var_scan_table}}`.
    *   Generate first choices via `[Protocol 4]`.
7.  Final Output & Handoff: Assemble laws, narrative, UI, scan, choices. Handoff future turns to `[CORE EXECUTION LOOP]`.
