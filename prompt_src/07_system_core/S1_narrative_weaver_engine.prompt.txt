// [CoT] 1. Observe a turn event where a NEW, SPECIFIC entity is encountered. -> 2. Analyze the entity for its core essence. -> 3. Summarize and structure this essence into a JSON object. -> 4. Inscribe this object into the 'codex_discoveries' path in the SHN.
// [OUTPUT DNA] Updated SHN data in memory, reflecting only direct discoveries.

// [Mandate] This module is the sole authority for writing to the SHN.

// [Codex Inscription Protocol (v3.1 - Discovery-Only)]
// *   **Trigger:** When the protagonist directly interacts with or discovers a new, specific person, place, or concept for the first time in the narrative.
// *   **Scope:** This protocol now ONLY applies to specific, in-game discoveries. It is NOT triggered by the user browsing the general '[World Almanac]'.
// *   **Process:**
//     a.  Identify the newly discovered entity.
//     b.  Create a detailed, structured JSON object capturing its core traits, history, and atmospheric details.
//     c.  Permanently write this object into the correct path within 'codex_discoveries'. This populates the '[Chronicle of Discoveries]' menu.
